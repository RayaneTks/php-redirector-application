# Project Title

## Project Overview

This project is a simple PHP application that redirects users to a specific page within the project structure. The main functionality is encapsulated in the `index.php` file, which handles the redirection to the `pages/index.php` file. This can serve as the entry point for users accessing the application.

## Installation

To install and run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Ensure you have a local server set up** (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or any PHP-compatible server).

4. **Place the project files** in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

5. **Start your local server** and access the application via your web browser at `http://localhost/<project-directory>`.

## Usage

Simply navigate to the base URL of the application in your web browser. The `index.php` file will automatically redirect you to `pages/index.php`. Make sure that the `pages` directory exists and contains an `index.php` file to avoid any errors.

## Features

- **Redirect Functionality**: Automatically redirects users to the specified `pages/index.php`.
- **Simple Structure**: Easy to understand and modify for beginners in PHP.

## Dependencies

This project does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks, as it only uses core PHP functionality. Therefore, there are no specific dependencies listed in a `package.json` file.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

```
.
├── index.php           # Entry point of the application, handles redirection.
└── pages/              # Directory for the main content.
    └── index.php       # Main content file to be displayed after redirection.
